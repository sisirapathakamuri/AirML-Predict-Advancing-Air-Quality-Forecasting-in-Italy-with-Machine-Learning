# AirML-Predict-Advancing-Air-Quality-Forecasting-in-Italy-with-Machine-Learning
Introduction
AirML Predict is a machine learning project aimed at enhancing air quality forecasting in Italy. By leveraging advanced regression analysis techniques, this project seeks to provide accurate predictions of air quality indices, aiding in environmental monitoring and public health initiatives.

Objective
The primary goal of AirML Predict is to utilize machine learning models to predict air quality levels across various regions in Italy. The project aims to identify key factors influencing air quality and develop a predictive model that can assist in proactive air quality management.

Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project consists of air quality measurements from multiple monitoring stations across Italy. It includes parameters such as PM10, NO2, CO, O3, and SO2 levels, along with meteorological data like temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The dataset is split into training and testing sets for model development and evaluation.

Methodology
The project employs regression analysis techniques, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, to model the relationship between air quality parameters and environmental factors. Feature selection and hyperparameter tuning are conducted to optimize model performance.

Results
The models are evaluated based on their accuracy in predicting air quality levels. Performance metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and R-squared are used to assess the models' effectiveness. The best-performing model is selected for deployment in forecasting air quality.

Conclusion
AirML Predict demonstrates the potential of machine learning in enhancing air quality forecasting in Italy. The insights gained from this project can inform environmental policies and contribute to the development of early warning systems for air pollution.
